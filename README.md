# Use Case

## Make Payment

Merchants and service providers can make payment by calling this service. Developer should call make_payment() method with payment request parameter. Shurjopay needs some information to perform creating payment request. So that, this service requires request payment object. After calling this service, it returns response object containing payment URL and customer information.

**Example**

- Payment Request

```python
payment_request = PaymentRequestModel(
            prefix='sp',
            amount=1000.00,
            order_id='sp215689',
            currency='BDT',
            customer_name='Mahabubul Hasan',
            customer_address='Holding no-N/A, Road-16, Gulshan-1, Dhaka' ,
            customer_phone='01700000000',
            customer_city='Dhaka',
            customer_post_code='1212',
            client_ip='127.456.1.1'
        )
payment_details = shurjopay.make_payment(payment_request)
```

- Payment Request Response

```
    payment_url= <generated payment url by shurjoPay gateway>
	amount=1000.00
	currency=BDT
	sp_order_id=sp32aad7c6dad7a
	customer_order_id=sp215689
	customer_name=Mahabubul Hasan
	customer_address=Holding no-N/A, Road-16, Gulshan-1, Dhaka
	customer_phone=01766666666
	customer_city=Dhaka
	customer_email=Null
	client_ip=127.456.1.1
	intent=sale
	transactionStatus=Initiated
	sp_code=null
	message=null
```

## Verify payment order:

After a successful payment, merchants or service providers have to verify payment order. Developers must call verify_payment() method with Shurjopay order id parameter that is provided by payment response named "sp_order_id". A successful verification returns an order object.

**Example**

- Request verification of an order

```
Parameter: sp_order_id
```

- Response

```
order_id=sp32aad7c6dad7a
currency=BDT
amount=10
payable_amount=10
discount_amount=null
discpercent=0
usd_mmt=0
usd_rate=0
method=null
sp_msg=initiated
sp_code=1068
name=mahabubul
email=mahabubul@example.com
address=Holding no-N/A, Road-16, Gulshan-1, Dhaka
city=Dhaka
value1=value1
value2=value2
value3=value3
value4=value4
